        <p>Progress in deploying measures to reduce emissions is off-track across transport, buildings, agriculture and land use. In these areas, progress to date is behind virtually every indicator we track, often by a wide margin.<br> <br>    
            Reductions in the CO2 emissions of new vehicles have fallen well short of our indicators. Lack of progress over several years has contributed significantly to surface transport now being the highest-emitting sector in the UK.<br><br>   

            Deployment of energy efficiency measures in buildings are running at less than 20% of the rate under our indicators, having fallen sharply since policy changes in 2012. Deployment of non-bioenergy low-carbon heat (e.g. heat pumps) remains weak.<br><br>

            Progress is falling short of all of our indicators across agriculture and land use, where policy has been lacking or ineffective in driving the necessary emissions reductions.

    <h3>What is the Net-Zero Challenge </h3>
    
    <p>In May 2019, the Committee recommended that the UK set a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target for 2050. The new target is achievable with known technologies, alongside improvements in people's lives, and within the expected economic cost that Parliament accepted when it legislated the existing 2050 target for an 80% reduction from 1990.</p><br><br>
    
    <p>There have been encouraging developments in greenhouse gas removals, but these will need deployment support to reduce costs and make a significant contribution to reaching net-zero emissions.</p>
    
    
    
    <div class="color">
    <h3>What is needed from the policy now in order for the Net-Zero challege to be completed</h3>
    
    <li>Delivery must progress with far greater urgency. </li><br>
    <li>Challenges that have not yet been confronted must now be addressed by Government.</li><br>
    <li>Clear leadership is needed, right across Government, with delivery in partnership with businesses and communities.</li>
    
     
    
   <img src="Time.jpg" alt="Time" class="Time">
    
    <div class="timeinfo3">
    
    <p><b>Many current plans are insufficiently ambitious; others are proceeding too slowly, even for the current 80% target:</b></p><br>
    
    <li>2040 is too late for the phase-out of petrol and diesel cars and vans, and current plans for delivering this are too vague.</li><br>
    <li>The voluntary approach that has been pursued so far for agriculture is not delivering reductions in emissions.</li><br>
    <li>Over ten years after the Climate Change Act was passed, there is still no serious plan for decarbonising UK heating systems or improving the efficiency of the housing stock, while no large-scale trials have begun for either heat pumps or hydrogen. The low-carbon skills gap has yet to be addressed.</li>
    </div>
    </div>
     
    <div class="agriculture3">
    <p><b>Agriculture.</b> There is a strong need to implement a policy framework to translate existing proposals and ambition into firm delivery plans, with new policies that cover the range of measures across soils and livestock required to reduce emissions on-farm.</p><br>
    
    <p>Public engagement.<br>

        <b>Healthy lifestyle choices.</b> People can take action immediately to improve their diet and increase the amount of walking and cycling they do. These changes can cut emissions and improve health. The Government must engage with people over why and how they can make these improvements, and take supporting actions (e.g. ensuring that road infrastructure encourages people to view cycling as a safe option).<br><br>
    
        <b>Hydrogen production.</b> In order to develop the hydrogen options, which are vital in our net-zero scenarios, significant volumes of low-carbon hydrogen must be produced at multiple industrial clusters by 2030, for use in industry and in applications that would not initially require major infrastructure changes.<br><br>
        
        <b>CO2 transport and storage infrastructure.</b> Plans for early deployment of CO2 transport and storage infrastructure linked to industrial clusters must be delivered with urgency - CCS is a necessity not an option for reaching net-zero GHG emissions.</p>

     <sup>It will be businesses that primarily deliver the net-zero target and provide the vast majority of the required investment. UK business groups have strongly welcomed the setting of the net-zero target and are already acting to reduce emissions. Policy should provide a clear and stable direction and a simple investable set of rules and incentives that leave room for businesses to innovate and find the most effective means of switching to low-carbon solutions.</sup>
